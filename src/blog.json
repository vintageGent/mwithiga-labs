Security isn't just about building walls; it's about making sure your doors have the right locks. <br><br><b>The Protocol:</b> I moved the primary entry point from Port 22 to Port 2222, disabled root login, and enforced a 3-attempt lockout. <br><br><b>The Challenge:</b> The biggest hurdle was the 'intent vs. configuration' gap — learning that a saved file in nano doesn't mean an active rule until verified by the radar (ss). The gateway is now verified and locked."

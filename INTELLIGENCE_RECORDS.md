## Part I: Strategic Dispatches (Executive Analysis)

### Executive Briefing Protocol: The "Executive Elevator Pitch"
**Objective**: Transitioning from technical lead to strategic advisor in direct communication with C-Suite stakeholders.

> "Mr./Ms. CEO, most organizations today are operating with a significant blind spot. In the eyes of the **Data Protection Act (2019)**, a single unhardened gateway isn't just a technical glitch—it’s a catastrophic reputation and financial risk. Mwithiga Labs doesn't just 'do IT.' We are a **Digital Risk & Compliance Intelligence Practice**. We translate the 'noise' of your servers into a strategic signal you can use to protect your brand. To provide this level of assurance, we deploy **The Sentinel**—our proprietary Intelligence Operative designed to map exposure, harden perimeters, and facilitate automated compliance."

## Part II: The Sentinel Operative (Technical Definition)

### What is Sentinel?
Sentinel is a **Local-First AI Desktop Intelligence Operative**. It serves as the primary technical interface for Mwithiga Labs' security and compliance assessments.

- **The Engine**: Built on the Accomplish AI core architecture for robust desktop automation.
- **The Intelligence**: Specialized LLM reasoning (Claude/GPT) tuned for executive risk analysis.
- **The Arsenal**: Direct orchestration of Mwithiga Labs' proprietary toolsets (`recon.py`, `threatscope.py`, `dpa-shield`).

### Access Model: Proprietary Intelligence
Currently, Sentinel is a **Proprietary Professional Tool**. It is held exclusively by Mwithiga Labs analysts to deliver high-assurance audits for clients. This ensures the "Secret Sauce" of the practice—its specific OSINT pivots and compliance logic—remains a unique competitive advantage.

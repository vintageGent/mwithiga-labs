## Record 001: Operational Consolidation (Hub Implementation)

**Date**: 2026-02-10
**Focus**: Workflow Efficiency & Tooling Integration

### Executive Summary
To reduce operational friction and improve response times during security audits, a centralized Intelligence Practice Hub has been implemented. This replaces individual script executions with a unified assessment framework.

### Technical Implementation
- **Centralized Execution**: Implemented `hub.py` using `rich.console` for a high-end terminal interface.
- **Environment Isolation**: Developed an automated virtual environment selection engine. Each module (Portal, ThreatScope, etc.) is now executed via its specific Python interpreter, ensuring stability across diverse dependency sets.

### Strategic Impact
The consolidation reduces "time-to-launch" for technical assessments and ensures a standardized interface for all digital risk audits.

## Record 002: Digital Exposure Discovery (Recon & Intelligence)

**Date**: 2026-02-11
**Focus**: Reverse Email Lookup & OSINT Linkage

### Executive Summary
The practice has expanded into passive reconnaissance. The "Digital Exposure Audit" module allows for the transformation of a single identifier (email) into a multi-platform identity map.

### Technical Implementation
- **Pivot Logic**: Developed `recon.py` featuring domain analysis (Personal vs corporate classification).
- **Automated OSINT Integration**: Implemented deep-link generation for platforms including EPIEOS, LinkedIn, and breach databases.

### Strategic Impact
This module allows for the identification of "Shadow IT" and credential exposure risks before they are exploited by hostile actors.

**Date**: 2026-02-11
**Focus**: Market Positioning & Tone Refactoring

### Executive Summary

### Technical Implementation
- **Asset Refactoring**: Total tone shift across all CLI tools and web dashboards.
- **Messaging Optimization**: Replaced seeker/adventure terminology with precision risk-based reporting.

### Strategic Impact
The practice is now positioned to attract premium SME and C-Suite clients requiring high-authority advisory services.
